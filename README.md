## Requirements
All required libraries can be found in the requirements.txt file.

## Running the Program
### Windows
Open the Command Prompt window and navigate to the scr folder of the project.

For me the src folder is here:
```
C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\time_based_stegochannels_artifact\src
```
The command to get to this is:
```
$ cd PycharmProjects\time_based_stegochannels_artifact\src
```
If it is your first time running the project you need to run the command:
```
$ pip install pycryptodome
```
Then run the following command:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
The program will now run in that terminal window.

### Linux
Open the terminal and navigate to the src folder

For me the folder is here:
```
~/PycharmProjects/time_based_stegochannels_artifact/src
```
The command to get to this is:
```
$ cd PycharmProjects\time_based_stegochannels_artifact\src
```
If it is your first time running the project you need to run the command:
```
$ pip install pycryptodome
```
Then run the following command:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
The program will now run in that terminal window.
