# Time based stegochannels artifact
Artifact Related to Thomas Hearmon's 2024 Newcastle University Dissertation

## Requirements
All required libraries can be found in the requirements.txt file.

## Running the Program
### Windows
Open the Command Prompt window and navigate to the scr folder of the project.

For me the src folder is here:
```
C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\time_based_stegochannels_artifact\src
```
The command to get to this is:
```
$ cd PycharmProjects\time_based_stegochannels_artifact\src
```
Then run the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```
The program will now run in that terminal window.
